# SkipCord-2
A Discord bot that integrates with Uhmegle to provide an automated Omegle-like streaming experience in a designated voice channel. It uses Selenium (Edge browser) for skipping, refreshing, starting, and stopping video sessions, and auto-enforces a camera-on policy by moving or timing out users who donâ€™t comply.
